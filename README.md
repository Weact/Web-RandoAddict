## COLLABORATION RULES

**1: Pulls Requests HAVE TO be reviewed by the assigned reviewer and updated by the assigned developer before closing and merging the pull request**

**2: NEVER merge into "main" branch but when a main feature has been completed, reviewed and certified as stable**

**3: Anytime a feature or a bug is completed, the branch should be merged to develop, which will be the main branch of the project. (Main will be for stable versions, milestone completions)**

**4: Every branches have to be named such as :**

	 - feature/nickname_<feature_name>
		for a feature
	 - hotfix/nickname_<bug_name>
		for bug fixing

**5: Merged branches should be safely deleted after a successful merge**
 
**6: Every commit should be properly named and describe precisely what has been done**

**7: A branch should has only one feature**
> When a part of a feature is completed, this part should be commited.
> This prevent from losing any unsaved work. You test your code or anything else, it works, you save and commit.
> Do not push until your feature is done. You are allowed to push if you wish to pull your work on another device, for example.

**8: When a branch is pushed, ALL CONFLICTS must be resolved locally**
> The conflicts should be resolved by the pull request author.
> To resolve conflicts locally with git bash, go on develop branch, pull to be up to date, go back on your branch and use `git merge develop` or `git rebase develop` if you wish to check commits by commits.

**9: When solving conflicts locally, the project HAS TO be tested before pushing to the distant branch**
